# Changelog for vesion 0.6.2

## User facing changes

- Show current time in GUI messages to ease debugging
- Switch to saving the logs together with the default config file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%` in windows (logs were previously being saved in `%USERPROFILE%`)
- Regularly ping local wallet while waiting for a session to detect wallet disconnects (should improve situation with long lived clients failing to complete a session once it's started)
- Interpret daemon setting `MaxSessionDuration` as a time string (with a suffix for defining the time units) and change default to `30s` (vs old `30`)

## Internal Changes

- Use Go modules and require Go 1.11
- Improve various unit tests in `splitticket` package
- Specify the correct `valueIn` for ticket and split transactions (vs using the old fixed `-1` value)
- Support Simnet
